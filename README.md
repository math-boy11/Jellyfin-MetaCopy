## Overview
This tool was created to help [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) users easily transfer metadata between items â€” especially useful when movies are mistakenly categorized as TV shows or episodes are misfiled as specials. Rather than manually re-entering metadata, this tool lets you copy it (including images) between any two items with a few simple steps!

## Setup
This tool requires a config file. Create a `config.properties` file and add your config options.

- serverUrl: The URL of your Jellyfin server. Make sure it does not have a slash at the end.
- apiKey: Create an API key in the Jellyfin admin dashboard (Dashboard -> API Keys)
- userId: The ID of any user that has access to both items
- sourceItemIds: The list of source item IDs
- targetItemIds: The list of target item IDs
- copyImages: Whether or not to copy the item images

Example:
```
serverUrl=<YOUR_JELLYFIN_SERVER_URL>
apiKey=<YOUR_JELLYFIN_API_KEY>
userId=95707b986fac4983b52aa8e7cdb5aafa
sourceItemIds=71b5224878d04bbcd5e0e3fc8b40418d,a6a98f32d0b331161bd1ac0f6a2aa204
targetItemIds=cf27cbd6644262ec30a48300024f70c3,502cdfc5fa705bc2a60392e41884ef42
copyImages=true
```

## Running
Download the latest JAR from [here](https://github.com/math-boy11/Jellyfin-MetaCopy/releases/latest/download/jellyfin-metacopy-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar) and run the tool with the following command. Java 21 or later is required.
```
