## Overview
This tool was created to help [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) users easily transfer metadata between items â€” especially useful when movies are mistakenly categorized as TV shows or episodes are misfiled as specials. Rather than manually re-entering metadata, this tool lets you copy it (including images) between any two items with a few simple steps!

## Setup
This tool requires a config file. Create a `config.properties` file and add your config options.

- serverUrl: The URL of your Jellyfin server. Make sure it does not have a slash at the end.
- apiKey: Create an API key in the Jellyfin admin dashboard (Dashboard -> API Keys)
- userId: The ID of any user that has access to both items
- sourceItemId: The ID of your source item
- targetItemId: The ID of your target item
- copyImages: Whether or not to copy the item images

Example:
```
serverUrl=<YOUR_JELLYFIN_SERVER_URL>
apiKey=<YOUR_JELLYFIN_API_KEY>
userId=95707b986fac4983b52aa8e7cdb5aafa
sourceItemId=0194df9f418205064cef85fa7359361e
targetItemId=4ca8a8288bbaf7b1370a7caec8c04828
copyImages=true
```

## Running
Download the latest JAR from [here](https://github.com/math-boy11/Jellyfin-MetaCopy/releases/latest/download/jellyfin-metacopy-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar) and run the tool with the following command. Java 21 or later is required.
```
java -jar NAMEOFJARADDLATER.jar path/to/config.properties
```

If you're a developer, you can clone the repository and run it using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
